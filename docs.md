# HTMLE DOSCS
# How it works
To add extensions you need to implement this script to youre code ```<script src="https://tommager1107.github.io/HTML-EXTENSIONS/htmle/data/index.js"></script>```
This script allows youre HTML file to understand extensions and fetch the things that are in the extensions file
To add extensions to you html file you will need to modofi file in DATA directory named extensions.txt in this file there are extensions you need to separate the extensions with space
Extensions are made on github with pages but more about creatin in #Creating youre extension and you need to add extension to extension.txt in DATA directory by putting lik to github page with code index.htmle
for example example.github.io/extension/index.htmle (idex.htmle can be also extension_name.htmle)

# How to create youre own extension 
To create youre own extension you need to understand our HTMLE language it is prety simmular to HTML but with some ad-ons.
For example <extension_funcion><implement: "FUNCTION_NAME"></extension_function>
