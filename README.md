# HTMLE (HTML Extensions)

HTMLE is a project aimed at extending the functionality of HTML through custom extensions. It provides a framework for creating, managing, and using extensions to enhance the capabilities of HTML documents.

## Overview

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating web pages. While HTML provides a rich set of elements and attributes for structuring and styling content, there are often situations where additional functionality is needed beyond what HTML offers out of the box. HTMLE addresses this need by introducing a system for defining and utilizing custom extensions within HTML documents.
